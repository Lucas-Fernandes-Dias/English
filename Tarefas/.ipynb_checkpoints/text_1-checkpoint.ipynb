You don’t like my friends, you get angry with me when I see them, and you don’t want me to succeed. You undermine me, nothing I say is correct, I can’t even choose a movie or order dinner, you think the things I’m interested in are ridiculous, everything is rational and calculated to you, you’re not supportive of my work, you don’t want to take me seriously, you want to own me and control everything, but people aren’t like – you can’t run their lives or drive your security from possessing them. You can’t expect me to spend my life trying to be what you think I should be”. “But I Love you!” \n",
